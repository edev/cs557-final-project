\section{Shakespearean Templates}

Yesod provides domain-specific languages (DSLs) over HTML, CSS, and Javascript, all named after Shakespearean characters. In converting my site, I migrated the HTML, CSS, and Javascript, in that order. (For the full, reference versions of all information in this section that's not otherwise cited, see \cite{ybkShakes}.)

All of Yesod's DSLs provide a common set of interpolation features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \term{Variable interpolation} All variables in scope when a template is rendered are available through variable interpolation. For instance, in my main site template, I write

    \code{<title>\#\{pageTitle pc\} - Sharing God's Bounty}

    to insert the value of \code{pageTitle pc} as part of the HTML title.

  \item \term{Resource interpolation} We can insert type-safe URIs via \code{@\{routeR\}} resource interpolation, as discussed in \nameref{resourcesAndTSURIs}.

  \item \term{Template interpolation} We can embed templates in other templates by writing \code{\^{}\{templateName\}}. This is safe in that it only allows embedding of templates of the same type and, of course, provides all the usual compile-time guarantees for both templates. \todo{Add reference to Mixins section?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hamlet}

Yesod uses Hamlet as its HTML DSL. Hamlet is similar to HTML, with a few distinguishing features.

\paragraph{Significant whitespace} Hamlet templates infer closing tags from indentation levels. When you write, for instance, \code{<div>}, everything that should appear inside this tag must be nested below it. A matching closing tag is automatically inserted at the correct place in the generated HTML. 

\paragraph{Class and ID shorthand} Hamlet templates provide shorthand for specifying classes and IDs by prefacing a class or ID name with a \code{.} or a \code{\#}, respectively. This shorthand even works with multiple classes, by writing either \code{<div .foo .bar>} or \code{<div ."foo bar">}. Either form generates the final HTML \code{<div class="foo bar"></div>}. To be honest, I tried these forms with the intention of exposing a shortcoming of Hamlet, and I was shocked to see that it handled both cases beautifully!

\paragraph{Example} To see these features in action, let's take a look at my mobile navigation menu. The Hamlet representation is as follows: \todo{UPDATE THIS EXAMPLE with the ``final'' version! It'll be WAY more impressive!}

\begin{Verbatim}
<nav .mobile>
  <ul>
    <li>Menu items go here. 
  <h2>
    Menu
\end{Verbatim}

Which compiles to:

\begin{Verbatim}
<nav class="mobile"><ul><li>Menu items go here. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Menu</h2>
</nav>
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{Shortcomings} There are, unfortunately, a number of shortcomings to Hamlet. First and perhaps most importantly, none of the four templating DSLs provide the strong, compile-time guarantees of correctness that we expect in Haskell, even though Hamlet in particular feels like it could. As a new user, I was genuinely surprised to learn that Hamlet doesn't raise compile-time errors for invalid tags! For instance, when I mistakenly wrote \code{<image ...>}, Hamlet happily generated both opening and closing \code{image} tags, which, understandably, confused both Firefox and me.

Second, although Hamlet knows that some tags like \code{img} are self-closing, it doesn't insert the closing \code{/} at the ends of such tags.

Third, Hamlet \emph{does not} check whether classes and IDs written in Hamlet notation exist in linked Cassius or Lucius files!

Fourth, the HTML produced seems to be both arbitrary and virtually unreadable in its structure. The navigation example above is Hamlet's output, verbatim, and this is with minimization disabled! What particularly irks me about this oversight is that Hamlet \emph{outright requires} proper indentation and spacing! Why it doesn't simply carry this indentation through to the final HTML is beyond my comprehension.

\subsection{Lucius}
To represent CSS, Yesod uses two, equivalent DSLs: Lucius, which is ``a superset of CSS'' \cite{...}, and Cassius, which uses significant whitespace instead of curly braces. I chose to use Lucius to ease the process the migration from Ruby on Rails.

Lucius and Cassius both present broadly similar feature sets to Sass, which my Ruby on Rails app uses for its CSS. In fact, in searching for help on Lucius mixins, I found a question by a Sass user who was similarly struggling with the Lucius equivalent \cite{...}. (More on that in the \todo{CORRECT Mixins} section.) Put simply, Lucius and Cassius aim to ease the process of writing CSS, \emph{not} to provide strong compile-time guarantees of the correctness of CSS.

\subsection{Basic features}

Lucius supports fairly standard features to simplify generating CSS. In addition to interpolation, it supports another, immensely useful feature: nesting selectors to reduce repetition. Other than the surprising (and unfriendly) syntactic detail that we write \code{@foo} to define a variable and \code{\#\{foo\}} to use it, Lucius feels familiar after working with Hamlet. With this understanding, I began migrating my Sass by writing some Lucius variables at the top of my \code{.lucius} file:

\begin{Verbatim}
@textcolor: #333;
@pageBGDark: #382916; /* Brown */
@pageTextLight: white;
@spacing: 20px;
@halfSpacing: 10px;
\end{Verbatim}

Here, \code{@spacing} and \code{@halfspacing} supported the grid on which I originally designed the layout and opened up a new possibility that, should I ever wish to adjust this grid, I might well be able to do so simply by changing these variables. However, this potential is limited somewhat by encountered another, unfortunate limitation I found while experimenting with this new idea: Lucius variables cannot invoke other Lucius variables. When we write, for instance: 

\begin{Verbatim}
@spacing: 20px;
@halfSpacing: calc(#{spacing}/2);

body {
  margin: 0 #{halfSpacing};
}
\end{Verbatim}

Lucius generates the CSS:

\begin{Verbatim}
body {
  margin: 0 calc(#{spacing}/2);
}
\end{Verbatim}

If Lucius supported either nested variables or some notion of compile-time calculation with variables, I might be able to scale nearly every element on the page according to the \code{@spacing}. It's disappointing that Yesod ships with this limitation, but it downright disheartens me that Lucius does not even notice that it's parsing very clearly invalid CSS!

Then, I updated my CSS to take advantage of all three forms of interpolation as well as nested selectors.

Topics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hamlet: went pretty smoothly, Initially had to cut out lots of features as NYI.
  \item Lucius/Cassius: oh, man. Whole subsection(s), whole big thing.
\end{itemize}

%   Migrate main HTML template, creating a list of features snipped out:
%     Christmas mode
%     Mobile menu
%     Meals served & last meal
%     Announcements
%     Main menu
%     Flash notice and alert
%     Footer: current year
%     Footer: login link
%   Migrate main CSS stylesheet to Lucius:
%     Integrate variables where appropriate
%     Convert image URLs to StaticR resources for compile-time safety
%     Nest CSS with shared tags (e.g. all .masthead selectors)
%     Mixins:
%       - Can't use the Yesod book's quasi-quoters readily in the scaffolded Yesod site, either in the Lucius file or in src/Foundation.hs (where defaultLayout is defined), because I need to annotate a type manually to deal with string overloading (Text vs. [char]), and I can't easily find the type of the QuasiQuoter used (because it far exceeds my level of knowledge of Haskell, GHCI, QuasiQuoters, and Yesod). 
%       - Google doesn't have any usable documentation on this that I've found.
%       - The Yesod wiki seems to be broken
%       - The LTS build of Yesod appears to be over 5 years old and appears to predate this: https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2013/07/runtime-lucius-mixins
%       - Because of either Stack or Yesod's package management, I can't import Text.Lucius from GHCI to check the type.
%       - However, I eventually realized that I could trick Stack/Yesod into telling me the correct type simply by writing a dummy type and checking the 'Expected' output! Oputput:
%               • Couldn't match expected type ‘Mixin’ with actual type ‘Int’
%               • In the first argument of ‘Text.Internal.Css.CDMixin’, namely
%                   ‘(centering "200px")’
%                 In the expression: Text.Internal.Css.CDMixin (centering "200px")
%                 In the expression:
%                   ((Text.Shakespeare.Base.DerefBranch
%                       (Text.Shakespeare.Base.DerefIdent
%                          (Text.Shakespeare.Base.Ident "centering")))
%                      (Text.Shakespeare.Base.DerefString "200px"), 
%                    Text.Internal.Css.CDMixin (centering "200px"))
%               |
%           163 |             $(widgetFile "default-layout")
%               |               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

%       - I changed the type annotation to Text -> Mixin and it worked perfectly.
%       - I learned while creating the HTML template that older versions of Yesod won't recognize new static files unless I stack clean && stack exec -- yesod devel, and that the LTS release I received from Stack is old enough that it has this issue.
%       - I learned while trying to get Mixins working that I also have to clean and rebuild if I change a Lucius mixin.
%     Limitation of variables:
%       - I tried converting my 20/10-pixel spacing to @spacing and @halfSpacing, with @halfSpacing defined as @halfSpacing = calc(#{spacing}/2);, but it doesn't process #{spacing} or even produce a compile error! It actually produces incorrect CSS!
%       - I found that if I leave a semicolon off a variable, it will also produce invalid CSS! What gives?!
%     Next steps:
%       1. Get good dummy content in
%       2. Get the CSS working well and looking right!
%       3. Continue refactoring the CSS
